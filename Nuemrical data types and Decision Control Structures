# Part 1:Calculate area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width.
# Get the length and width from the user
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width

# Display the result
print(f"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}")


# Part 2: Takes the user's name as input. Greets the user with a personalized message including their name.
# Get the user's name as input
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Greet the user with a personalized message
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to our city.")


# Part 3: Program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:
# Get the temperature in Celsius from the user
celsius = float(input("Enter the temperature in Celsius: "))

# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# Display the converted temperature
print(f"{celsius} °C is equal to {fahrenheit} °F.")


# Part 4: Converts time in seconds to hours, minutes, and remaining seconds:
# Get the time in seconds from the user
seconds = int(input("Enter the time in seconds: "))

# Calculate hours, minutes, and remaining seconds
hours = seconds // 3600
minutes = (seconds % 3600) // 60
seconds = seconds % 60

# Display the converted time in the requested format
formatted_time = "{:02d} hours, {:02d} minutes, {:02d} seconds".format(hours, minutes, seconds)
print("Converted time:", formatted_time)
